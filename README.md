# orefine-exhibit

This is an [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/) extension that allows you to export the data along with the facets as an [Exhibit 3.0](https://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/) web page.
This can be seen as taking a snapshot of your open refine project. You can then save it, publish it online, or share it with others without requiring Open Refine.

The exported Exhibit will contain:
* List and numeric facets added at the moment of exporting (even facets that use more complex GREL expressions).
* Filters applied to the data will be applied to the  exported data.

I think it is cool that this extension brings two of [David Huyhn](http://davidhuynh.net/)'s creations together.

## Installation
Download the ZIP archive from the [relaeses tab](https://github.com/fadmaa/orefine-exhibit/releases) and then follow [the instructions to install Open Refine extensions](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installing-Extensions).
